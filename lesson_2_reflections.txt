1) When you initialize a repository, a .git directory is created.  You need to manually make the first commit.

2) Working area is the actual directory on your machine.  The staging area is a logical queue for files that will be committed.  The repository is a logical structure that contains files that have been commited.

3) The staging area can be used to make sure you have one commit per logical change by staging the file(s) after each logical change is made.

4) Branches could be useful for adding experimental features, new options like languages, or entirely different feature sets.  Once the feature is stable, the branch can be merged back into the main branch if so desired.

5) Diagrams help visualize branch structure by making it easy to see relationships between commits and view any unreachable commits.

6) Gits auto merging is helpful when there are no conflicts.  When conflicts exist, the user must manually resolve them.
